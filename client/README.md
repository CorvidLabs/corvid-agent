# CorvidAgent Client

Angular 21 mobile-first dashboard for managing agents, sessions, councils, and on-chain messaging.

## Development

```bash
bun run dev:client   # from project root — starts Angular dev server on :4200
```

## Build

```bash
bun run build:client # production build to client/dist/
```

The server serves the built client from `client/dist/client/browser/` automatically.
